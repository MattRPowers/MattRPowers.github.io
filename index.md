## Welcome to my page

I am a student at Umass Amherst who has been working on theater and art all my life. 

I have been in over a handful of plays, all being given main male leads.
### The Crucible

The Crucible by Arthur Miller was my most recent play in senior year of high school where I played _John Proctor_.
